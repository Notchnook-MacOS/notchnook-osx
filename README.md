## What is NotchNook?  

NotchNook Mac is a **customization app** designed to give purpose and style to the notch found on newer MacBook models. Instead of treating the notch as wasted space, NotchNook repurposes it into a small but useful area where you can display system information, quick-access indicators, or fun visual effects.  

The app also introduces features that **mimic the dynamic island effect**, allowing notifications and interactive elements to appear around the notch. This makes your MacBook both more functional and more visually engaging.  

### With NotchNook Mac you can:  
- Show **real-time system info** like battery status, CPU load, or WiFi strength.  
- Add **visual effects or animations** to make your device feel unique.  
- Turn the notch into a **mini productivity hub** for quick information.  
- Enjoy a **dynamic island experience** similar to what you see on modern iPhones.  

The tool is lightweight, simple to configure, and optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) Macs. It runs in the background without affecting performance, making it perfect for users who love personalization but don’t want resource-heavy software.  

If you’ve ever wished your MacBook’s notch could serve more than just a design purpose, NotchNook offers a fun and practical way to get more from your display.
